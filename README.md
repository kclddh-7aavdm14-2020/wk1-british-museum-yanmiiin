# Week 1 : British Museum blog post

## Getting started

Welcome to the first week's exercise, a blog post about your expedition to the British Museum website. This is just to get you warmed up and used to writing with angle brackets, and used to pulling from and pushing onto GitHub.

The first thing to do is to clone this repository onto your personal computer, so that you can edit it.

1. Hit the green Code button above, then `HTTPS`. Copy the long URL which begins with https://github.com/ by pressing the clipboard icon on the right.
2. Open Visual Studio Code on your computer
3. Click the Source Control icon on the left (third icon from top, three joined circles), then "Clone Repository". Paste in the copied url.
4. You will be asked to select a folder to clone this repository (ie download the code) into. Choose one that makes sense to you. (Advice: keep a KCL folder and in that a module folder, in that a cultural-web folder).  Hit enter.
5. When VS Code has cloned everything, a menu should pop up in the bottom right asking if you want to open it. Hit Open!
6. Now you're in. Select index.html and edit away. See below for a selection of tags to use.
7. To see how this appears in a browser, right click on your code and select Open in Other Browsers. After you make a change in the html, refreshing the page in the browser to update it.

## HTML tags of the week

Now you can write a 250 word blog post about your expedition to the British Museum within the HTML template in this repository.

Write your post within the opening and closing `<body>` tag. 
  
Make sure to use the following tags:
- `<p>`  : for a new paragraph
  - eg: `<p>This is a paragraph</p>`
- `<h1>` : for a title
  - eg: `<h1>This is a title</h1>`
- `<h2>` : for a subtitle
- `<h3>` : for a subsubtitle
- `<em>` : italicise
- `<strong>` : bold

## To push your changes back to GitHub 
**You don't have to have finished! It's good practice to push often**

Make sure to push your post up to GitHub when you're ready to share, or when you're having problems. Make sure you've saved your work. Click Source Control, and then look for the tick icon âœ“. Click that, an input field will drop down. It's asking for a message that describes your changes. Maybe you want to say something like, 'Added first paragraph' or 'Finished blog post' or something like that. Press enter.  Finally, click the icon made of three dots (...) to the right of the tick, and then press 'Push'.

Check your assignment page - your changes should appear in the index.html file?
